<div><p>In this paper I argued for increased interoperability of digital map collections as a method of improving accessibility of these collections and supporting educators and map librarians using historical maps in instruction. I discussed the evolution of online collections of historical maps over time and described the limitations to access and use that exist with current technology. I noted that in parallel with reduction of technological barriers to access there is a need for more geospatial instruction in libraries and for librarians tasked with providing information services to users of these collections. Through my research I identified emerging practices that address these issues, notably the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF). I proposed that universal adoption of a geospatially enabled IIIF protocol (IIIF + navPlace) for delivery of map images would allow educational materials incorporating these objects and tools for discovering them online to be more widely usable, in turn supporting geospatial educators with a range of experience levels working in a variety of library roles and other educational settings. </p></div>
