## Manifest Builder Webapp

I'm toiling away on this gallery builder idea, and will post about it soon.

In order to use images from the Internet Archive in any IIIF viewer you have to build the manifest URL by copying the image identifier and pasting it into a structured URL. 

I've been doing this in a random Google doc. High on the success of bossing chatbots into generating code for me, I asked Gemini 2.5 pro to make this webapp that builds the URL for me.
